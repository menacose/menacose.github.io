### Description
Discover how AI copilots are reshaping the practice of systems engineering. In this INCOSE MENA Expert Talk, we’ll show practical ways copilots can accelerate requirements analysis, design exploration, document authoring, and knowledge reuse across complex programs—safely and responsibly.

This session is open to everyone, including non‑members. Join us for free and see how AI can amplify your engineering work.

Shaping the Future of Systems Engineering in the MENA Region.

### What you’ll learn
- Where AI copilots fit in the systems engineering lifecycle
- Real use cases: intelligent information retrieval, proposal and document drafting, traceability support, and knowledge management
- How to get value quickly while staying compliant with policy, IP, and security constraints
- Common pitfalls, guardrails, and lessons learned from early adopters

### Agenda
1. Welcome and context: AI in Systems Engineering today
2. Copilot capabilities and patterns that work in SE
3. Live walkthrough of an SE copilot workflow
4. Risks, governance, and adoption roadmap
5. Q&A

### Who should attend
Systems engineers, project and product leaders, discipline SMEs, and anyone exploring practical, policy‑aware ways to apply AI on engineering programs.
