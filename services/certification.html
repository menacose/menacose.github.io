				<p>The INCOSE Systems Engineering Professional (SEP) certification is a globally recognized credential that formally acknowledges your expertise and progress in the field of systems engineering. It validates your ability to develop and apply systems engineering knowledge and practices effectively throughout your career.</p>
				<p>INCOSE offers three levels of certification:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Associate Systems Engineering Professional (ASEP):</strong> Ideal for those at the beginning of their systems engineering journey, focusing on foundational knowledge.</li>
					<li><strong>Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP):</strong> Recognizes individuals with demonstrated systems engineering experience and competency.</li>
					<li><strong>Expert Systems Engineering Professional (ESEP):</strong> The highest level, awarded to seasoned professionals with significant leadership and technical contributions to the field.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Certification is a formal process conducted by a community of knowledgeable, experienced, and skilled representatives of INCOSE. It confirms an individual's competency, which includes demonstrated knowledge and experience in systems engineering. Unlike licensing, which is granted by a government entity, certification is a professional recognition. It also differs from a "certificate," which simply documents the completion of a training or education program.</p>
